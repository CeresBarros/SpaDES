# Spatial Discrete Event Simulation (SpaDES)

*A package to develop and run spatially explicit discrete event simulation models.*

Easily implement a variety of simulation models, with a focus on spatially explicit agent based models. The core simulation components are built upon a discrete event simulation framework that facilitates modularity, and easily enables the user to include additional functionality by running user-built simulation modules. Included are numerous tools to visualize raster and other maps.

## Installation

To install `SpaDES` from github you will need the `devtools` package:

    install.packages("devtools")
    library("devtools")

Then install `SpaDES`:

    install_github("achubaty/SpaDES")
