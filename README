Spatial Discrete Event Simulation (SpaDES)

R package for building spatially explicit discrete event simulation models.

Implement a variety of simulation models, with a focus on spatially explicit raster models and agent based models. The core simulation components are built upon a discrete event simulation framework that facilitates modularity, and enables the user to include additional functionality by running user-built simulation modules. Included are numerous tools to visualize raster and other maps.
