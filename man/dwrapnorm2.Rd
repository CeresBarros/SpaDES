\title{Vectorized wrapped normal density function}
\usage{
dwrpnorm2(theta, mu, rho, sd = 1, acc = 1e-05, tol = acc)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{value at which to evaluate the density function, measured in radians.}

\item{mu}{mean direction of distribution, measured in radians.}

\item{rho}{mean resultant length of distribution.}

\item{sd}{different way of select \code{rho}, see details below.}

\item{acc}{parameter defining the accuracy of the estimation of the
  density.  Terms are added to the infinite summation that defines the
  density function until successive estimates are within \code{acc} of each
  other.}

\item{tol}{the same as \code{acc}.}
}
\description{
This is a modified version of \code{\link{dwrpnorm}} found in \code{CircStats}
 to allow for multiple angles at once (i.e., vectorized).
