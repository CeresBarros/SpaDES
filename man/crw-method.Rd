\title{Simple Correlated Random Walk}
\usage{
crw(agent, stepLength, sd, lonlat)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{A SpatialPointsDataFrame.}

\item{stepLength}{Numeric vector of length 1 or number of agents describing
                   step length.}

\item{sd}{Numeric vector of length 1 or number of agents describing
                   standard deviation of wrapped normal turn angles.}

\item{lonlat}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, coordinates should be in degrees.
                   If \code{FALSE} coordinates represent planar ('Euclidean')
                   space (e.g. units of meters)}
}
\value{
An agent object with updated spatial position defined by a single
         occurence of step length(s) and turn angle(s).
}
\description{
This version uses just turn angles and step lengths to define the correlated random walk.
}
\details{
This simple version of a correlated random walk is largely the version that
was presented in Turchin 1998, but it was also used with bias modifications
in McIntire, Schultz, Crone 2007.
