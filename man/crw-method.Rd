\usage{
move(hypothesis = "crw", ...)

crw(agent, stepLength, stddev, lonlat)
}
\arguments{
\item{hypothesis}{a character vector, length one, indicating which movement hypothesis.
Currently defaults to crw to call the \code{crw} function.}

\item{...}{arguments passed to the function in \code{hypothesis}}

\item{agent}{A SpatialPoints* object.}

\item{stepLength}{Numeric vector of length 1 or number of agents describing
                   step length.}

\item{stddev}{Numeric vector of length 1 or number of agents describing
                   standard deviation of wrapped normal turn angles.}

\item{lonlat}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, coordinates should be in degrees.
                   If \code{FALSE} coordinates represent planar ('Euclidean')
                   space (e.g. units of meters)}
}
\value{
An agent object with updated spatial position defined by a single
         occurence of step length(s) and turn angle(s).
}
\description{
Wrapper for selecting different animal movement methods.

This version uses just turn angles and step lengths to define the correlated random walk.
}
\details{
This simple version of a correlated random walk is largely the version that
was presented in Turchin 1998, but it was also used with bias modifications
in McIntire, Schultz, Crone 2007.
