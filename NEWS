Known issues: https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES/issues

version 0.6.0
=============
* new module dependency checking and metadata structure (#126)
* new module structure (#125):

        moduleName/
        |_ moduleName.R    # the actual module code file, incl. module metadata
        |_ moduleName.Rmd  # longform documentation and usage info, etc.
        |_ citation.bib    # properly formatted bibtex citation for the module
        |_ LICENSE         # license file describing the allowed usage etc. of the module
        |_ README          # incl. module metadata in addition to version change info, etc.

* modules now require metadata; module code without it will break!
* deprecated use of `reloadModuleLater`
* added new relational operators to account for floating point errors
* added `dplyr`, `magrittr`, and `httr` to `Imports`

version 0.5.0
=============
* transfered project to `PredictiveEcology/SpaDES` from `achubaty/SpaDES`.
* overhaul to Plot function, now does not need `*Named` objects.
* Deprecated all `*Named` functionality
    * All code will break that uses `*Named` objects
* Reduced number of packages on which SpaDES "depends".
* A new function, clearPlot can be used to clean all hidden metadata about a plot
* A new function, randomPolygons, will create random raster maps (not vector maps) of polygons
* Plot now handles SpatialPolygons objects much faster than default plot. Uses package fastshp.
    * The suggested package `fastshp` can be installed with:

        install_github("s-u/fastshp")

* bugfixes

version 0.4.0
=============
* second public ("beta") release
* more improvements to Plot function, including dramatically faster for files on disk
* added second "Model" that adds and integrates 3 sample modules, Fire, Succession and Aging
* added Plotting vignette
* bugfixes


version 0.3.1
=============

* first public ("beta") release
* reworked plotting and visualization (it's faster, more reliable)
* added additional parameter checks and improved debugging
* new and improved documentation:
    - two new vignettes (introduction to SpaDES and how modules work)
    - new demo highlighting visualization components
    - more complete code documentation
* numerous bug fixes

version 0.2
=============

* renamed package to SpaDES

version 0.1
=============

* first working alpha version
* lots of "wishlist" items still to be implemented
